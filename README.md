<h1>Sequence Reordering Neural Network</h1> 
<b>Developed for the project exam of the the Deep Learning course of the Artificial Intelligence Master's Degree at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna</b>

Python Notebook file contains the code for a small neural network which is tasked with sentence reordering.
The network was built from scratch following the basic Transformer architecture, it achieved over 90% performance on the task, while the project itself achieved an evaluation of 30/30.
